Workflow<br>
1.Collected a predefined SMS dataset containing spam and ham messages.<br>
2.Preprocessed data(labeled spam=1,ham=0).<br>
3. Converted text into numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorizer.<br>
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets. <br>
5.Trained the model using Logistic Regression Classifier.<br>
6.Evaluated model's accuracy.
